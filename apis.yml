      The Debbie APIs are a RESTful interface, allowing you to programmatically
      update, add and access much of your data on the platform. It provides
      predictable URLs for accessing resources, and uses built-in HTTP features
      to receive commands and return responses. This makes it easy to
      communicate with third party systems.
